When did you learn the value of your time? During college? After landing your first job? Or was it something you learned growing up? 

At 15 years old, future Telemundo president Nely Galán was already beginning to understand the value of self-motivation when it comes to maintaining a productive schedule. As author Daymond John explains in his 2018 book, Rise and Grind, the precocious Cuban teenager had been offered a guest editor position at Seventeen Magazine after she was pushed to graduate early from her Catholic high school for writing an exposé about a teacher who had falsely accused her of plagiarism. The teacher later told Galán that her writing was on par with Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea (1952), something the teacher didn’t believe Galán capable of reproducing. Luckily, Seventeen believed in the young writer. Her new position was unpaid, but it allowed Galán to get vital experience she later used to begin her career on television. [1] 

As a teenager from a low-income, immigrant family, Galán couldn’t simply rely on unpaid work at Seventeen. The frequent travel between Galán’s home in New Jersey and Seventeen’s office in New York required her to take on a retail job to make ends meet. She also had to schedule babysitting shifts between her magazine assignments and her second job. To juggle all three jobs, Galán had to train herself to get up early so she could get a head start on her most important tasks. That’s a habit she’s continued throughout her career, allowing her to become a best-selling author and renowned television producer while still getting eight hours of sleep most nights. [2] 

Galán’s ability to juggle multiple jobs while still putting out a regular stream of entertainment journalism as a younger writer can be credited in large part to her time management skills. Without learning how to prioritize tasks and break down big goals into small steps, Galán wouldn’t have been able to generate the body of work she’s produced over her career. [3] 

Stephen King, another celebrated author, has written dozens of books, film scripts, and short stories by diligently dedicating a portion of his schedule every day to working on his latest project. In his highly praised book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft (2000), King discusses how he usually is able to complete a new manuscript in three months, writing at an average of 10 pages a day. Works that have taken him longer, such as On Writing, often become neglected in some drawers for months or years until King decides to allot the time necessary to tackle the task. King has been able to become one of the most famous authors of his generation because he consistently breaks his work down into daily projects; in other words, his fame is owed, in large part, to his ability to manage his time effectively. [4] 

The relentless hustle demanded by most Western businesses has made it easy for professionals in many lines of work to feel busy without getting much done. However, by balancing focused periods of work with ample amounts of rest, anyone can learn how to get the most out of each day. In his 2016 book, Deep Work, Cal Newport explains that due to the rise in both automation and outsourcing, workers must be able to quickly master difficult tasks and produce quality work consistently and efficiently. To be able to deliver both of these requirements, employees must be able to reach states of deep work—moments in which they can concentrate fully on the task at hand to produce the best results. [5] 

The path to improving time management starts with a better understanding of existing obligations and habits. Comparing daily activities to actual priorities will make it easier for workers to realize when they’re committing to actions that actually further their ambitions, and when they’re merely wasting energy on tasks that merit less attention. As Newport explains, the ability to concentrate on tasks individually, rather than multitasking, is essential to creating the conditions for the sort of deep work that leads to maximum productivity. Otherwise, workers will likely find that some of their attention remains scattered between the various obstacles they need to tackle. Minimizing the time it takes to complete distracting, daily chores can provide the space needed to create and pursue long-term goals. [6] 

The Perils of the Daily Grind 

After author and financial executive Robert Pozen became president at Fidelity Investments, he fell into the habit of taking time out of his schedule to attend presentations by professionals who were visiting the Fidelity offices. The speeches were interesting, but they didn’t help Pozen get any closer to accomplishing the goals he considered to be his primary objectives. [7] 

As he explains in his 2012 book, Extreme Productivity, Pozen was engaging in what he calls structured procrastination: the process of procrastinating on a large task by completing some other activity that is either less important or less difficult. While structured procrastination is better than doing no work at all, it can still be a major hindrance to meeting greater ambitions. For example, an employee might promise herself that she’ll work on her quarterly goal at the start of each day, but instead find herself drawn to the tremendous amount of conference and speaking invitations she’s received, and feel compelled to respond to each one. Prioritizing those invitations over her long-term projects will make her less likely to complete them, and will potentially stymie her ability to take on roles requiring more responsibility at her company. [8] Company executives and other superiors will be unlikely to offer her challenging projects, since she seems to struggle to go beyond the bare requirements of her daily duties because she’s always jetting off to give talks. [9] 

Pozen handles daily tasks and distracting opportunities with a system he calls OHIO—Only Handle It Once. When he receives an invitation to an event, a request for help, or an email from a colleague, he immediately decides whether the query is worth a response. The vast majority of outside requests for attention, time, or expertise he ignores, especially if they come from advertisers and PR firms. He also chooses to ignore most internal memos, at least until more important tasks are accomplished. The few requests that are worth responding to are the ones Pozen deals with immediately, before they can be forgotten or set aside. By ignoring less important requests in favor of those that will make the largest impact toward his future goals, Pozen is able to reclaim hours he might otherwise lose on tasks that add little to the company’s bottom line. His OHIO system can also be implemented for household maintenance or social ambitions. For example, a married couple can choose, for the sake of finances, to decline most of the invitations they receive to weddings and other events celebrating the accomplishments of acquaintances so that they can afford to attend special occasions thrown by friends living in faraway locations. [10] 

For those with good time management, ignoring or minimizing tasks that don’t contribute to long-term goals is an essential skill. The number of tasks employees are asked to do daily can make it feel as if each workplace demand has equal weight. Learning how to prioritize, however, requires reviewing personal ambitions and setting discrete deadlines that can be used to make gradual progress toward those goals. [11] A certain amount of flexibility is also needed when it comes to pursuing goals; the actions of professionals may not always land the job they covet, but it may open them up to a better opportunity they hadn’t even considered. [12] 

Getting Your Priorities in Order 

So: what are your major goals at work? And what are you doing to meet them? How much time do you spend on going to meetings and filling out forms? How do you spend your time after work? Is it helping you connect with your family? Or to become a better, fully engaged member of your community? 

These are some of the questions that Pozen recommends ambitious workers ask themselves when they decide they need to manage their time more effectively. The list highlights an important disconnect: although almost everyone has heard the old adage “time is money,” how they think about these two precious resources can be surprisingly divergent. Many people have a fairly decent idea of how they spend their money; even those who don’t excel at budgeting would likely be able to answer questions about where they went on vacation and how much they spent to get there. When it comes to estimating how much time they spend on activities, however, people tend to have much more difficulty getting to an accurate number. One sales manager told Pozen that he had once asked his team members how much time they spent working directly with clients. His employees guessed they spent more than 60 percent of their time on that activity, but visiting clients actually only accounted for about a third of their time. [13] 

One way to spot a schedule that’s misaligned with long-term goals is to first decide on steps that can be used to advance goals that will likely take between one and five years to achieve. After a goal is broken down into prospective tasks, individuals can meticulously record each of their daily actions to examine how their activities either contribute to, or detract from, their ability to incrementally progress toward their ambitions. [14] 

In his 2018 book, The Bullet Journal Method, author Ryder Carroll provides a method for recording daily activities and later evaluating their true relevance to personal and professional life. Adherents to his journaling system use a writing style called rapid logging to quickly jot down tasks and events in a daily log. The daily log can also be used to briefly note important events or to set reminders about future meetings. In order for the activity to take up the minimum possible amount of time, Bullet Journal users are asked to keep their entries as succinct as possible. For example, instead of using full sentences to note an upcoming meeting with a potential new hire, an executive could use her Bullet Journal to write “Interview: Meet applicant @ cafe Monday, 9 a.m.” Notes about major victories and failures should be kept just as succinct as notes on more mundane activities. The journal is meant to be a record of experiences and upcoming tasks, rather than a more traditional log of feelings and emotions. [15] 

Once Bullet Journal users have completed a daily log, they can start a daily reflection page where they consider which of their activities were most productive, and which were a waste of time. Ideally, this reflection process should be carried out at the end of the month, when Bullet journalers can more thoroughly examine their daily actions and decide which tasks are no longer irrelevant, and which they should spend more time on. During the reflection period, Bullet journalers should ask why they are engaging in each activity, what they get out of it, and whether it aligns with present goals. While questioning the usefulness of each task might seem like a waste of time, the activity can gradually make it easier for anyone to identify and cut out unproductive habits. [16] 

When deciding which tasks to prioritize, it’s also important to consider that professionals rarely are able to fully set their own priorities. For example, if a woman works at a company with a fixed management structure, her personal ambitions and priorities at work may not always align with those of her boss. Even those who are self-employed sometimes may have to seek out opportunities that do not fully align with their larger goals, but which do provide the finances to fund that pursuit. Pozen recommends that workers divide their tasks into two categories: enabling tasks and assigned tasks. Enabling tasks are those which advance goals that people have set for themselves; assigned tasks, as the name implies, are those which are required by someone else. [17] 

Maximizing productivity also requires the ability to develop habits that allow for the completion of routine tasks more quickly. That process involves the ability to assess how much energy various tasks require. Without learning how to effectively conserve and spend energy, employees will find it difficult to ever learn how to manage their time, no matter how long they spend scrutinizing their schedule. [18] 

Rituals of Success 

Crossing off unnecessary daily chores is one way to slim down an overextended schedule, but the habit of making a schedule in the first place—and sticking to it—is often the true key to better time management. That’s because effective schedules revolve around positive rituals, and rituals are one of the most powerful time-saving strategies that humans have discovered. 

Famed tennis player Ivan Lendl wasn’t considered the most talented athlete of his generation. Despite that, many of his fellow players, including his rival John McEnroe, admitted that Lendl was inarguably the most dedicated, both on and off the court. Lendl kept a strict diet and a regular eating schedule no matter what. He completed an intense exercise routine at specific times, and subjected himself to a number of habitual mental exercises meant to keep his focus sharp. At tournaments, he was fully focused on the match, but he was equally committed to scheduling routine breaks for rest, recreation, and relaxing activities. Lendl’s ability to stick to such a grueling regimen might understandably be mistaken for willpower. However, grit alone is hardly a sufficient explanation. Humans are inherently drawn to habit; the vast majority of a person’s actions can be traced either to routine or to spontaneity in response to surprise or anxiety. Lendl was able to stick to his schedule simply because he had grown accustomed to it over the years; he had used the process of creating positive rituals to become a world champion. [19] 

Rituals, when used to encourage positive thought or action, are crucial components of time management because engaging in them ultimately saves energy. Every time employees use willpower to stay on task at work, their energy is depleted to some extent. The more difficult or unfamiliar the task, the more energy it takes to complete. Rituals, by virtue of their inherent familiarity, take far less energy because they require less active attention and concentration, and therefore less willpower. [20] In addition to conserving energy for more challenging tasks, rituals provide the structure and comfort necessary to weather difficult professional or personal periods. If a husband learns that his wife is facing a potentially terminal illness, for example, their morning breakfast ritual can provide the familiarity and interpersonal connection necessary to help him handle the increased stress. Since they often are used to reinforce values and principles, rituals can be used not only as a tool to save time and effort, but also as a source of emotional renewal. [21] 

Don’t Get Restless 

Rituals shouldn’t only be used to facilitate better work habits. In fact, implementing routine periods of rest is just as important as striving for productive behavior while on the clock. Without the ability to relax and take their mind fully off work, people will soon find themselves incapable of keeping up with the daily workload. Rather than producing results, constant effort is far more likely to lead professionals to burnout. [22] 

Many people have trouble adequately separating their experiences at work from their personal lives. At work, for example, an employee’s mind might wander to an argument with her daughter or to unpaid bills. At home, her mind might still linger with the assignments she didn’t finish or with the slightly rude comment a coworker made. Fully disconnecting is a difficult, but necessary, component of preserving and restoring energy, so that it’s easier to engage in effective time management. [23] 

To learn how to incorporate effective periods of rest, employees should start by learning how to include short but meaningful breaks in their schedule. Human attention spans tend to wander after an hour and a half; after two hours of dedicated work, a worker has little hope of making substantial progress in a timely manner. Allowing for routine 15- or 30-minute breaks can improve focus among workers and increase overall production. To provide the maximum amount of restored energy, these breaks should not be spent thinking about work tasks. Talking a walk outside the office, or even visiting other colleagues to chat about topics unrelated to work, can provide a brief mental break so that employees return to their work refreshed. Longer periods of rest, like vacations, should also be pursued regularly. Barring employees from doing work on vacation can help ensure that they return to the office rejuvenated and ready to work. [24] 

While rest is imperative to proper time management, it can also be detrimental if overindulged. To reach peak performance, rest must be balanced with stressful moments that strengthen skills. Just as building muscles requires moments of stress and recovery, learning time management requires an equal exchange between effort and relaxation as well. [25] 

How to Manage Time 

The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin (1791) might be over two centuries old, but it still contains much of the same wisdom on time management that can be found in this era’s more popular self-help books. Just as Pozen, Carroll, and other recent time management experts have advised workers to stick to a schedule, create rituals, and focus on top priorities, Franklin’s autobiography implored readers to rise early, work consistent hours, and prioritize ample rest. Franklin, who became renowned as a writer, politician, inventor, and philosopher, managed to perform all of those roles and more while still making time for two-hour lunches and seven hours of nightly sleep on average. Today’s workers can do the same, albeit without the pressures of founding a country. [26] 

As with all skills, learning time management is not an instantaneous process. However, the process of learning how to manage time is relatively simple. Want to manage your time better? Here’s a recap: 

1. Don’t get distracted by daily demands. Avoid focusing solely on work-related tasks that prevent you from progressing on long-term goals. Find ways to quickly tackle low-priority requests. Most emails, invitations, and requests for expertise can safely be ignored; those that are worth replying to, however, should receive a response immediately. 

2. Figure out your professional and personal ambitions for the next week, month, year, and five years. Rank tasks and obligations by importance and the time they will take to complete. Note any tasks required to either remain profitable or to meet the expectations of higher-ups, and figure out how to complete those activities while still pursuing individual goals. 

3. Implement rituals that reinforce positive behavior and reduce the amount of energy needed to complete necessary tasks. Use these rituals to preserve time and energy for challenges which require more concentration and willpower. 

4. Balance work with routine rest. Aim to disconnect fully with whatever task is not immediately at hand. When at the office, focus on work. At home, find some ritual that can help you put your profession aside in favor of personal pursuits. Take regular breaks during the workday to refresh energy and focus. 

Implementing new rituals and evaluating daily actions may require significant investment at first, both in terms of time and energy. Eventually, however, the process of managing time and balancing professional goals with personal pursuits will become second nature. By learning effective time management, anyone can achieve a fuller, more satisfying life, one in which intentional action directly decreases wasted effort and time.
